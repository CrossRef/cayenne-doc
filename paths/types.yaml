    summary: Enumeration of DOI work types
    description: |
      The `/types` endpoint returns a list of work types for which DOIs may
      be registered. The work types are taken from deposit XML. While they
      may not correspond exactly in name, there is a one-to-one mapping
      between API work types and DOI types in Crossref deposit XML.
